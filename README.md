# UPF InfoJobs Demo

## Overview
This repository hosts the UPF InfoJobs Demo project, a Python-based web application designed for job analytics. The application, primarily developed using Streamlit and Jupyter Notebook, focuses on processing and visualizing job-related data.

## Functionality
- Data Visualization: Utilizes `vis_streamlit.py` for graphical representation.
- Web Interface: `final_streamlit.py` serves as the main script for the Streamlit-based web application.
- Docker Support: Includes a `Dockerfile` for containerization.
- Deployment: Contains `new-streamlit-deployment.yaml` for deployment purposes.

**Note**: The application's state management feature is currently under development. Interaction with the application (like clicking or modifying inputs) is not advised if it's running.

## Installation
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Run `final_streamlit.py` to launch the app.
